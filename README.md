# Quiz

A React tutorial by [John Smilga.][john smilga]  
This is a course exclusive tutorial you can purchase [here][john smilga lesson]. The original tutorial repository is available for free [here][john smilga lesson git].

The rest of this readme is about my expectations before and my experience after completing the project. I would suggest using the links above if you're interested in learning about the project from its original creator.

## ::BEFORE.

#### what I expect.

As it's being explained it seems like a very complex app with multiple data sets, but I suspect this app is mainly about taking a large complex set of data and filtering it down several times and presenting it to the user. I am excited to try some of the more simple types of programming that appears to be in this lesson though. It also seems like more of a complete app.

## ::AFTER

#### what stood out.

Using axios library to do the ajax requests.

All of the simple data filtering I thought we would be doing programmatically was taken care of by the api. The app was fairly straight forward but had a lot of parts and many state values.

Using an object for form controlled input values was a good idea and kept the number of state values from getting unmanageable.

Using multiple boolean state values to control which components get rendered gives the app the appearance of being multi-paged and also controls how we want the user to progress through the app.

I liked that I started to understand the workflow for using react components and by the end was able to see where things were going before they were explained.

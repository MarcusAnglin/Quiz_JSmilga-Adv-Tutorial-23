# Quiz

A React tutorial by [John Smilga.][john smilga]  
This is a course exclusive tutorial you can purchase [here][john smilga lesson]. The original tutorial repository is available for free [here][john smilga lesson git].

The rest of this readme is about my expectations before and my experience after completing the project. I would suggest using the links above if you're interested in learning about the project from its original creator.

## ::BEFORE.

#### what I expect.

As it's being explained it seems like a very complex app with multiple data sets, but I suspect this app is mainly about taking a large complex set of data and filtering it down several times and presenting it to the user. I am excited to try some of the more simple types of programming that appears to be in this lesson though. It also seems like more of a complete app.

## ::AFTER

#### what stood out.
